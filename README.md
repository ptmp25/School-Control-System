# Desktop Information System (DIS)

The Desktop Information System (DIS) presented here embodies the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), providing an advanced solution for data management within educational institutions. Leveraging OOP, DIS offers a robust framework for transitioning from traditional paper-based processes to a dynamic digital platform.

## Overview

This report thoroughly explores DIS, highlighting its adherence to OOP principles throughout its design and implementation. From its architecture and functionality to its software requirements and coding structure, DIS embodies the core tenets of OOP, enabling scalability, flexibility, and code reusability. Built on Windows Forms using C# and integrated with a MySQL database, DIS showcases how OOP methodologies can create a cohesive and efficient system.

## Features
